        My name is Jaron Bloom, and I am currently a Computer Science student
        with an interest in technology and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being self-driven, has allowed me to learn technologies and
        programming languages which are either not taught in my classes or not
        in my program.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge of programming is why I enjoy it. There is a thrill when
        you get stuck on a problem that is not easy to figure out. Then the feeling 
        of satisfaction when you are able to solve the problem is amazing.
