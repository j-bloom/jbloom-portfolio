      <p>
        Its not just programming that I am interested in, it's many aspects of 
        Computer Science. I enjoy tinkering and trying new things. This is probably 
        why I enjoy using the technologies that I choose for day to day tasks, 
        as a lot of custimization can be done. It's probably also why I enjoy 
        flashing my old phone with different custom ROMs just to see how different 
        they are and try them out. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also having an interest in security is another reason why I choose the 
        tools that I do.
